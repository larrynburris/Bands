## Bands

### What is Bands?

Generic method wrapper implementation in .NET

Bands allows you to add one or more layers of functionality around a method call. The benefit of this is isolating functional requirements from any boilerplate dependencies like diagnostics, persistaence, and validation. You can use built in bands or make your own!

### How can I learn more?

The [wiki](https://github.com/larrynburris/Bands/wiki) has a getting started guide and also outlines built-in bands. 

### Where can I get it?

This repository is currently the only location where Bands is available for download. Feel free to clone or fork this repo to get started with Bands today. As the project matures, I will make a NuGet package available.
